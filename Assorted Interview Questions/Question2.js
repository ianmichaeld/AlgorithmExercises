/*
The regular expression 'pattern' should match a number followed by a pair of matched brackets containing any number of (non-bracket) characters. The variable 'times' will capture the number, while the variable 'toRepeat' will capture the characters within the brackets.

The below could be implemented without mutating the passed argument by simply working on a copy of the argument within the function, although this would increase the function's space complexity.
